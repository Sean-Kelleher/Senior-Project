# Senior-Project
Work in progress of my undergrad senior project. Currently doesn't completely work.

To use: 
The server runs using node.js, interacting with a MySQL database created using script.sql.
Create a timeline using inputtimeline.html.
Create trends using inputtrend.html.
Create events using inputevent.html.
main_view.html displays an interactive visualization of the database.
