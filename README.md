# Senior-Project
My undergrad senior project. More features may be added in the future.
Needs node.js and MySQL to run.

The server runs using node.js, interacting with a MySQL database created using script.sql (Enter "source [path to script.sql]" into mysql terminal to create database, enter "node [path to server.js]" in node command prompt to start the server.)
Create a timeline using inputtimeline.html.
Create trends using inputtrend.html.
Create events using inputevent.html.
main_view.html displays an interactive visualization of the database, as seen below:
